# Mannequin Paladin
### A CMST 323 (Game Programming) final project by Jonathon Gabay [(site)](http://recursiveraccoon.xyz)

This game is a final project for a game programming course. Using a simple style (8-bit), I hope to be able to focus less on graphical components, and more on gameplay experience. This README file will contain the GDD for the game.

First off, I found a nice graphic while I was doing some light research on designing the MVP. I found [this article](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/minimum-viable-product-mvp-and-design-balancing-risk-to-gain-reward) to be helpful, specifically this graphic:

### Minimum Viable Product
#### Functionality:
*Player can move along the ground, jump, and attack.
*Player and mobs have health system to determine damage taken, and deaths.
--*By extension, Player and mobs have hit boxes, and react to being hit.
*Mobs can move on their own, either by "patrol" or towards Player.
#### Reliability:
*Player does not encounter bugs or issues related to playable area (falling through map, clipping through walls).
*Player reacts intuitively to taking damage, and controls behave responsive and clean.
*Mobs behave consistently and predictably within the bounds of their abilities.
*Any scripted events or triggers fire as they should, and don't produce unexpected effects.
#### Usability:
*Controls are simple and intuitive.
*Controls behave entirely as intended.
#### Emotional Design:
*Story and gameplay compels Player to continue through the provided levels.
*Story adds a level of immersion, despite simplistic style.
